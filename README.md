*Links* form the connection between everything on the internet with each other. Nowadays, not a day goes by for the average user without clicking a few links here and there. Links, ultimately, are a way to navigate online content.

With this new influx of many links, we want to make sure that these links serve their very purpose that comprises of three things :-
- Making sure the receiver receives the **right link** to the **right content**.
- Making sure the link is safe and is sent between the two respected parties **only**.
- Making sure the link is **simple and memorable**, one that also **respects content and user privacy**.

This can all be done with the help of a ***Link Sharing*** and ***Link Shortening*** software like **Linkborg**.

## Link sharing

### What is link sharing?

*Link sharing* is the process of sending a secure digital file to another person via a simple URL link. With link sharing, individuals can effortlessly direct others to valuable content, websites, articles, documents, videos, or any other online resource without having to worry about any constraints to file size or quality.

### How does one go about link sharing? 

1. **Upload your file:** A link sharing platform requires you to upload your file to the platform. 
2. **Generation of unique link:** After that, the link sharing platform will create a unique link that redirects to your file. Once the link is made, it is ready to be distributed to others on other platforms.
3. **Distribute the unique link:** The link can be copy-pasted into an email or a messenger platform and you don’t have worry about any size issues.

### Why do you need a link sharing software?

Sharing a file can be really arduous and unnecessarily complicated. Mostly due to size issues in the files themselves, one often has to move constantly between file sharing platforms to find the right platform to meet their sharing needs.

Link sharing is a practical step forward both for your personal and official needs. Let’s look at some situations where secure link sharing improves our file-sharing experience by ten-fold:

1. **Education**: Teachers can share links to educational resources, articles, or online tutorials with students, facilitating remote learning and enhancing access to supplementary materials.
2. **Event Invitations**: Event organizers can share links to registration pages or event details, simplifying the process for attendees and generating interest.

As such, link sharing provides a simple and more efficient way to share and communicate with others on the internet. While we make many links for many different purposes, it begs the question on how we can better organise and rename these links so that we don't accidentely send the wrong link to the wrong person. That is where **link shorteners** comes into play.
